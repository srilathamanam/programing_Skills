Write the algorithm to find given number is divisible by an even number;

Begin
Step 1: Read any two numbers x,y;
Step 2: if(y%2==0)    // this is verifies wheahter y is even or not
	{
	   if(x%y==0)
		print("given number is divibile by even number");
	   else 
		print("given number is not divibile by even number");
	}
	 else print("divisor is not a  even number");
end;


Write the algorithm to find sum of first natural numbers
1+2+3+4.....+n 

Start
Step 1: s=0,i=1,  Read any number say n
Step 2: While(i<=n)
	{
	    s=s+i;   
	    i=i+1;
	}
Step 3: Display s;
End
